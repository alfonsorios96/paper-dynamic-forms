# Paper Dynamic Forms

This web component gives to the frontend developer a tool to create polls, quiz and other kinds of forms dynamically.

## Installation

<snippet>bower install --save alfonsorios96/paper-dynamic-forms</snippet>

## Usage

```html
<paper-dynamic-forms type="text-input" sentences="[[config]]"></paper-dynamic-forms>
```

The diffents types are: "text-input", "option-input", "checkbox-input" and "radio-button-input"

The attribute 'sentences' is an array that defines the fields to make.

Of course, in change of a js array config, you can use a Polymer array inside your own web component.

Other idea is use iron-ajax and a JSON file for declare your forms definitions and get it in a object, then use it with this component.

```js
let config = [{
    label: 'Some label',
    options: ['option a', 'option b', 'option c']
}];
```

Inside of config (or whatever you want named) has two properties.
The first one defines the placeholder or label to display to the user and the other one (options)
is a string array with the options for the fields need it. E.g. checkbox-input or option-input.
